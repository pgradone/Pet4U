Get a pet for your life

Rehome a pet
Established in 1999, Help-A-Pet is a nonprofit organization with a single purpose: to provide financial assistance for the medical care of pets whose owners are unable to afford the expense. Our efforts focus on serving low-income disabled, elderly and working families, nationwide.
We find homes for unwanted cats, dogs, small pets and horses across the UK and our tailor-made service means we help each pet find the right person for them.
Our tiny staff handles the administrative duties, application review, and communicates with owners and veterinarians to save the lives of pets from low-income families. But, YOU are also a huge part of our organization. The funding that is able to support these pets comes directly from generous and compassionate people like you. We bring the pets to you, and YOU do the magic.
